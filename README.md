# Modular NodeJs Starter (in progress)

> The most common web app development approach had become **Server API** and **Client App** separation. 
> Sometimes this approach has issues with **Search Engine Optimization** (SEO), 
> and more traditional **server-side rendering** with additional **REST api** is required.
>
> That's why we've built this beautiful starter :)
