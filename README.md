# Modular Node Starter

> Web development has changed a lot latest year. The most common approach had become Server API and Client App separation. 
> Sometimes this approach has issues with SEO, and we need more traditional server-side rendering with additional REST api.
> That's why we built this well-structured and organized simple starter :)
